# QA ZERO Architecture

This document provides an overview of the QA ZERO architecture for developers who want to understand the system's components and how they interact.

## System Overview

QA ZERO consists of several key components:

- **Core Tracking System**: JavaScript code that collects user interaction data
- **Data Storage**: File-based and database storage for collected data
- **Data Processing**: Background processes that analyze and aggregate data
- **Admin Interface**: WordPress admin panels for viewing analytics and configuring the system

## Component Details

### Core Tracking System

The tracking system is implemented as JavaScript that is injected into WordPress pages. It:

- Captures page views, clicks, scrolls, and other user interactions
- Sends data to the server via AJAX calls
- Handles user consent and privacy settings

### Data Storage

QA ZERO uses a hybrid storage approach:

- Raw data is stored in files in the `wp-content/qa-zero-data` directory
- Processed data is stored in WordPress database tables
- Session recordings are stored as compressed JSON files

### Data Processing

Data processing is primarily handled by WordPress cron jobs that:

- Aggregate raw data into meaningful metrics
- Generate heatmaps from click and scroll data
- Calculate conversion rates and other KPIs

### Admin Interface

The admin interface is integrated into the WordPress admin panel and provides:

- Dashboard widgets for quick insights
- Detailed reports and visualizations
- Configuration options for tracking and privacy settings

## Data Flow

1. User visits a page with QA ZERO tracking code
2. JavaScript collects interaction data
3. Data is sent to the server via AJAX
4. Raw data is stored in files
5. Cron jobs process the raw data
6. Processed data is stored in the database
7. Admin interface displays the processed data

## Coming Soon

More detailed architecture documentation will be added in future updates.
