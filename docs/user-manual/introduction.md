# Introduction to QA ZERO

Welcome to the official documentation for QA ZERO – a privacy-focused, AI-enabled independent analytics server solution.

## What is QA ZERO?

QA ZERO is an independent analytics server solution that uses WordPress as middleware for easy installation and management. While it's distributed as a WordPress plugin for convenience, QA ZERO functions as a standalone analytics server that provides comprehensive website analytics without relying on cookies.

Unlike traditional WordPress plugins that extend WordPress functionality, QA ZERO uses WordPress primarily as an installation framework and management interface. This approach simplifies deployment while providing powerful analytics capabilities that operate independently of WordPress's core functions.

## Key Features

- **Independent Analytics Server**: QA ZERO operates as a standalone analytics solution, with WordPress serving as the deployment and management layer.
- **100% Cookieless Tracking**: Capture meaningful analytics without using cookies or personal identifiers.
- **Self-hosted by Default**: Own your data. QA ZERO runs entirely on your infrastructure — no external servers required.
- **AI-powered Insights (Optional)**: Enhance your analytics with optional AI agents for insights and automation.
- **Heatmap & Session Recording**: Visualize user behavior and replay actual user journeys.
- **Conversion Goal Tracking**: Define and monitor important user actions on your site.
- **Fast, Lightweight, and Privacy-first**: Built with performance and compliance in mind.

## Architecture Overview

QA ZERO consists of three main components:

1. **WordPress Integration Layer**: Handles installation, configuration, and provides the management interface.
2. **Analytics Server Core**: The independent engine that processes and analyzes visitor data.
3. **Data Collection Scripts**: Lightweight JavaScript that captures user interactions on your website.

This architecture allows QA ZERO to provide powerful analytics capabilities while leveraging WordPress for ease of installation and management.
