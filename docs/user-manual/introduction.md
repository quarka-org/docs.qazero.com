## About QA ZERO

QA ZERO is a privacy-focused, independent analytics server solution.

Although it is distributed as a WordPress plugin, it is not a typical WordPress extension.  
WordPress is used as an installation and management interface, while the analytics engine operates independently.

As a result, certain architectural and operational aspects differ from standard WordPress plugins.
