# QA ZERO Documentation Revision Plan

## Overview

Based on the review document, the QA ZERO documentation needs significant revisions to address fundamental misconceptions about the product's nature and to correct inaccuracies in feature descriptions. This plan outlines the approach for updating the high-priority pages identified in the review.

## Key Issues to Address

1. **Fundamental Misconception**: QA ZERO is incorrectly described as a typical WordPress plugin, when it's actually an independent analytics server solution that uses WordPress primarily as middleware and for installation.

2. **Inaccuracies and Non-existent Features**: The documentation references features that don't exist in the actual software, particularly in the heatmap section.

3. **Operational Reality**: Need to emphasize that QA ZERO operates as a standalone analytics server software, with WordPress being simply the deployment method.

## High-Priority Pages Revision Plan

### 1. Introduction (`/docs/user-manual/introduction.md`)

**Current Issues**:
- Describes QA ZERO as a "self-hosted WordPress plugin" rather than an independent analytics server
- Doesn't clarify the relationship between WordPress and QA ZERO

**Revision Plan**:
- Rewrite the introduction to clearly explain QA ZERO's nature as an independent analytics server
- Clarify that WordPress is used primarily as middleware and for installation
- Update the "What is QA ZERO?" section to reflect this accurate description
- Maintain the key features but frame them in the context of an analytics server

### 2. FAQ (`/docs/user-manual/start-guide/faq.md`)

**Current Issues**:
- References to QA ZERO as a WordPress plugin
- May include questions about non-existent features
- Doesn't address common questions about the analytics server nature

**Revision Plan**:
- Update answers to reflect QA ZERO's nature as an analytics server
- Add new FAQs that address the relationship between WordPress and QA ZERO
- Verify all mentioned features exist in the actual product
- Remove or mark as "Coming Soon" any features not yet implemented

### 3. Installation (`/docs/user-manual/start-guide/installation.md`)

**Current Issues**:
- Frames installation purely in the context of a WordPress plugin
- Doesn't explain that this is installing an analytics server via WordPress

**Revision Plan**:
- Maintain the installation instructions but add context about what's being installed
- Clarify that the WordPress plugin is a deployment method for the analytics server
- Add a section explaining the architecture (WordPress as middleware)
- Update the "Verifying Installation" section to reflect what users should actually see

### 4. Initial Setup (`/docs/user-manual/start-guide/initial-setup.md`)

**Current Issues**:
- References to settings that may not exist
- Describes heatmap setup which may be inaccurate
- Doesn't frame setup in the context of configuring an analytics server

**Revision Plan**:
- Verify all mentioned settings exist in the actual product
- Update the heatmap setup section to reflect actual functionality
- Reframe the setup process in the context of configuring an analytics server
- Ensure all UI navigation paths are accurate

### 5. Heatmap Usage (`/docs/user-manual/screens-operations/heatmap-usage.md`)

**Current Issues**:
- Incorrectly describes dedicated heatmap settings
- Navigation paths may be inaccurate
- May reference features that don't exist

**Revision Plan**:
- Update to reflect that heatmap functionality is accessible through the "Analytics" menu
- Focus on how to view and interpret heatmaps rather than non-existent settings
- Verify and update the types of heatmaps available
- Provide accurate navigation paths to access the heatmap feature

### 6. Overview (`/docs/user-manual/screens-operations/overview.md`)

**Current Issues**:
- May reference screens or features that don't exist
- Doesn't frame the overview in the context of an analytics server

**Revision Plan**:
- Verify all mentioned screens exist in the actual product
- Update descriptions to reflect actual functionality
- Reframe the overview in the context of an analytics server
- Ensure all UI navigation paths are accurate

## Implementation Approach

1. **Verification First**: Before making any changes, verify the actual functionality and UI of QA ZERO to ensure accuracy.

2. **Consistent Terminology**: Develop a consistent terminology guide to ensure all pages use the same terms to describe QA ZERO's nature and functionality.

3. **Phased Implementation**: Update the high-priority pages first, then move on to the remaining user manual pages.

4. **Review Process**: After updating each page, review for consistency with the new understanding of QA ZERO's nature.

## Next Steps

1. Develop a terminology guide for consistent language across all pages
2. Verify actual QA ZERO functionality and UI
3. Update the Introduction page first to establish the correct framing
4. Proceed with updates to the remaining high-priority pages
5. Review all changes for consistency
