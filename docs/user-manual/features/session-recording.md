# Session Recording

QA ZERO's session recording feature allows you to watch real user interactions with your website.

## How Session Recording Works

Session recording captures:

- Mouse movements
- Clicks
- Scrolling
- Page navigation
- Form interactions

All recordings are stored securely and can be accessed from your WordPress admin panel.

## Viewing Recordings

To view session recordings:

1. Navigate to the Session Recording section in the QA ZERO dashboard
2. Browse the list of available recordings
3. Click on a recording to play it
4. Use the playback controls to pause, rewind, or fast-forward

## Privacy Considerations

Session recording is designed with privacy in mind:

- Sensitive data like passwords and credit card numbers are automatically masked
- You can configure which pages to record and which to exclude
- User consent options are available to comply with privacy regulations

## Coming Soon

More detailed documentation on using the session recording features will be added in future updates.
