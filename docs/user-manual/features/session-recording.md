# Session Recording

QA ZERO's session recording feature allows you to watch real user interactions with your website without using cookies.

## How Session Recording Works

Session recording captures:

- Mouse movements and cursor position
- Clicks and interactive elements
- Scrolling behavior and scroll depth
- Page navigation and multi-page journeys
- Form interactions and input fields
- Time spent on different sections of the page
- Browser resize events

All recordings are stored securely on your own server and can be accessed from your WordPress admin panel.

## Viewing Recordings

To view session recordings:

1. Navigate to the Session Recording section in the QA ZERO dashboard
2. Browse the list of available recordings with filtering options
3. Click on a recording to play it
4. Use the comprehensive playback controls:
   - Play/Pause
   - Rewind/Fast-forward
   - Playback speed adjustment (0.5x to 2x)
   - Timeline scrubbing
   - Session navigation between pages

## User Information Display

Each recording provides detailed information about the visitor:

- **User Details**: Anonymized ID, new/returning status, country
- **Access Information**: Landing time, referrer source, page view count
- **Device Information**: Device type (desktop, tablet, mobile), operating system, browser

## Session Navigation

For multi-page sessions, QA ZERO provides:

- Visual playlist of all pages visited by the user
- Thumbnails and titles for each page in the journey
- Automatic playback of the next page in sequence
- Direct navigation to any point in the user journey

## Analysis Tools

QA ZERO provides powerful tools for analyzing session recordings:

- **Filtering Options**: Filter recordings by:
  - Date range
  - Device type
  - Traffic source
  - Goal completion
  - Page URL
  - Session duration

- **Integration with Other Features**:
  - View heatmaps for the same page
  - Analyze conversion paths
  - Identify usability issues
  - Correlate with analytics data

## Privacy Considerations

Session recording is designed with privacy in mind:

- Sensitive data like passwords and credit card numbers are automatically masked
- Form input fields can be selectively excluded from recording
- You can configure which pages to record and which to exclude
- User consent options are available to comply with privacy regulations
- All data is stored on your own server, not transmitted to third parties
