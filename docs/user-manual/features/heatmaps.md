# Heatmaps

QA ZERO's heatmap feature visualizes how users interact with your website.

## Types of Heatmaps

- **Click Heatmaps**: Shows where users click on your pages
- **Scroll Heatmaps**: Visualizes how far users scroll down your pages
- **Movement Heatmaps**: Tracks mouse movement across your pages

## Generating Heatmaps

To generate a heatmap:

1. Navigate to the Heatmaps section in the QA ZERO dashboard
2. Select the page you want to analyze
3. Choose the type of heatmap you want to generate
4. Set the date range for data collection

## Analyzing Heatmaps

When analyzing heatmaps, look for:

- Areas with high engagement
- Clickable elements that aren't being clicked
- Content that users aren't seeing (below the scroll fold)

## Coming Soon

More detailed documentation on using the heatmap features will be added in future updates.
