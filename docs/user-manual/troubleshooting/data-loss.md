# Troubleshooting Data Loss

If you're experiencing data loss or missing data in QA ZERO, this guide will help you identify and resolve common causes.

## Types of Data Loss

### Complete Data Loss

Complete data loss occurs when all historical data disappears from your QA ZERO dashboard.

Possible causes:

1. **Database Reset**: Accidental use of the "Reset Data" function
2. **Plugin Reinstallation**: Uninstalling and reinstalling the plugin without proper backup
3. **Database Corruption**: Server issues affecting the WordPress database

### Partial Data Loss

Partial data loss occurs when some data is missing for specific time periods or pages.

Possible causes:

1. **Tracking Interruption**: Temporary issues with the tracking script
2. **Data Processing Errors**: Background processing failures
3. **Data Retention Settings**: Automatic deletion of older data
4. **Content Filtering**: Exclusion rules preventing data collection

## Diagnosing Data Loss Issues

### Check Data Collection Status

1. Navigate to **QA ZERO > Dashboard**
2. Check the dashboard for recent data
3. If recent data is visible, data collection is currently working

### Verify Recent Data

1. Navigate to **QA ZERO > User**
2. Set the date range to "Today" or "Yesterday"
3. Check if recent data is being recorded
4. If recent data exists but historical data is missing, the issue is likely with stored data rather than collection

### Check WordPress Database

1. Use a database management tool like phpMyAdmin
2. Check the WordPress database tables related to QA ZERO
3. Verify that the tables exist and contain data

### Review WordPress Error Logs

1. Check your WordPress error logs
2. Look for errors related to QA ZERO
3. Note the timestamps of any relevant errors

## Common Causes and Solutions

### Data Retention Settings

QA ZERO automatically removes old data based on your retention settings:

1. Navigate to **QA ZERO > Settings**
2. Select the **Site Management** tab
3. Check the **Data Retention Period** setting
4. If set to a short period (e.g., 30 days), older data will be automatically deleted
5. Adjust the setting to a longer period if needed
6. Note that changing this setting will not restore already deleted data

### Database Issues

Database corruption can cause data loss:

1. Use a database management tool like phpMyAdmin
2. Check the WordPress database tables related to QA ZERO
3. Repair or optimize the database tables if needed

For severe database issues:

1. Check your server's error logs for database-related errors
2. Contact your hosting provider for assistance with database repair
3. Restore from a backup if available

### Tracking Script Issues

If the tracking script was temporarily disabled or broken:

1. Navigate to **QA ZERO > Tag**
2. Verify that the tracking code is properly installed
3. If using a caching plugin, clear your cache
4. Check your site again to see if tracking is working

### Plugin Conflicts

Other plugins may interfere with QA ZERO's data collection or storage:

1. Temporarily deactivate other plugins one by one
2. After each deactivation, check if QA ZERO data collection works
3. If you identify a conflicting plugin, check the [Plugin Compatibility](/docs/user-manual/site-environment/plugin-compatibility) section for specific guidance

### Server Resource Limitations

Limited server resources can prevent data processing:

1. Check your server's PHP memory limit and execution time
2. Ensure your server meets the minimum requirements (PHP 5.6+, 64MB memory)
3. If resources are limited, contact your hosting provider about upgrading

## Recovering Lost Data

### From Backup

If you have a backup of your WordPress database:

1. Restore the database from backup
2. Verify that QA ZERO tables are included in the backup
3. Reactivate the plugin if necessary

### Using WordPress Database Tools

If you need to recover data from a corrupted database:

1. Use a database management tool like phpMyAdmin
2. Check the WordPress database tables related to QA ZERO
3. Repair or optimize the database tables if needed
4. If necessary, consult with a database administrator

### From Browser Cache

In some cases, limited data may still exist in visitors' browsers:

1. Note that QA ZERO uses localStorage for some temporary data
2. This data is limited and may not represent a complete recovery solution
3. For reliable data recovery, always maintain regular database backups

## Preventing Future Data Loss

### Regular Backups

Set up regular database backups:

1. Use a WordPress backup plugin or your hosting provider's backup tools
2. Ensure that database backups include QA ZERO tables
3. Configure backup frequency and retention
4. Store backups in a secure location (local or cloud)

### Optimize Server Resources

Reduce the risk of data processing failures:

1. Ensure your server meets the minimum requirements (PHP 5.6+, 64MB memory)
2. Consider upgrading your hosting plan if you have a high-traffic site
3. Regularly check server logs for errors or warnings
4. Keep WordPress and all plugins updated

### Monitor Site Performance

Monitor your site's performance:

1. Regularly check the QA ZERO dashboard for any anomalies
2. Use WordPress health check tools to monitor overall site health
3. Set up uptime monitoring for your website
4. Regularly check for plugin conflicts
