# Troubleshooting License Errors

If you're experiencing issues with your QA ZERO license, this guide will help you identify and resolve common license-related problems.

## Common License Errors

### Invalid License Key

If you see an "Invalid License Key" error:

Possible causes:

1. **Typo in License Key**: The license key was entered incorrectly
2. **Expired License**: The license has expired and needs renewal
3. **Revoked License**: The license has been revoked due to terms violation

### License Activation Limit Reached

If you see a "License Activation Limit Reached" error:

This means you've activated the license on the maximum number of sites allowed by your license tier.

### Connection Error

If you see a "Connection Error" when trying to activate or verify your license:

This indicates that your WordPress site cannot connect to the QA ZERO license server.

### License Deactivated Unexpectedly

If your previously activated license shows as deactivated:

This can occur if the license was deactivated from another location or if there are connectivity issues.
