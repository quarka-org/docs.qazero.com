# Heatmap Usage

Heatmaps are visual representations of user behavior on your website. They help you understand where users click, how far they scroll, and where they move their mouse on your pages.

## Types of Heatmaps

QA ZERO offers several types of heatmaps:

### Click Heatmaps

Click heatmaps show where users click on your page. Areas with more clicks appear "hotter" (red/orange), while areas with fewer clicks appear "cooler" (blue/green).

![Click Heatmap Example](/img/placeholder-image.png)

Use click heatmaps to:
- Identify which elements attract the most attention
- Discover if users are clicking on non-clickable elements
- Optimize the placement of important links and buttons

### Scroll Heatmaps

Scroll heatmaps show how far users scroll down your page. The color gradient indicates the percentage of users who reached each part of the page.

Use scroll heatmaps to:
- Determine if users see important content below the fold
- Identify the optimal placement for key information
- Improve page layout to encourage deeper scrolling

### Move Heatmaps

Move heatmaps track mouse movement patterns, showing where users hover their cursor.

Use move heatmaps to:
- Understand what content attracts user attention
- Identify areas that users find interesting but may not click on
- Optimize the placement of important information

## Creating a Heatmap

4. Select the pages you want to track:
   - Specific URL
   - URL pattern (using wildcards)
   - Page type (homepage, posts, pages, etc.)
5. Choose the type of heatmap (click, scroll, move)
6. Set the data collection period
7. Click **Create Heatmap**

## Viewing and Analyzing Heatmaps

To view and analyze your heatmaps:

1. Navigate to **QA ZERO > Heatmaps**
2. Select the heatmap you want to view
3. Use the date range selector to filter data by time period
4. Use the device filter to view data for specific devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)

### Interpreting Heatmap Data

When analyzing heatmaps, look for:

- **Hot spots**: Areas with high user engagement (red/orange)
- **Cold spots**: Areas with low user engagement (blue/green)
- **Unexpected patterns**: Clicks on non-clickable elements or unusual scroll patterns
- **Fold line**: The point where users need to scroll to see more content
- **Engagement drop-offs**: Points where user engagement significantly decreases

## Comparing Heatmaps

QA ZERO allows you to compare heatmaps to identify changes in user behavior:

1. Navigate to **QA ZERO > Heatmaps**
2. Select the heatmap you want to use as a baseline
3. Click **Compare**
4. Select another heatmap to compare with
5. Use the comparison view to see differences between the two heatmaps

To export heatmap data for reporting or further analysis:

1. Navigate to **QA ZERO > Heatmaps**
2. Select the heatmap you want to export
3. Click **Export**

5. Click **Download**

## Best Practices

- Collect data for at least 1,000 page views to ensure statistical significance
- Create separate heatmaps for desktop and mobile users
- Compare heatmaps before and after making changes to your website
- Use heatmaps in conjunction with other analytics data for a complete picture
- Regularly review heatmaps to identify optimization opportunities
