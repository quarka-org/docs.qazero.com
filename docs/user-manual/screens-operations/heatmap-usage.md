# Heatmap Usage

Heatmaps are visual representations of user behavior on your website. They help you understand where users click, how far they scroll, and where they move their mouse on your pages.

## Accessing Heatmap Functionality

To access heatmaps in QA ZERO:

1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard
2. Navigate to **QA ZERO > Behavior** in the main menu
3. Select the page you want to analyze
4. Click on the **Heatmap** button for that page

## Types of Heatmaps

QA ZERO processes visitor data to generate several types of heatmaps:

### Click Heatmaps

Click heatmaps show where users click on your page. Areas with more clicks appear "hotter" (red/orange), while areas with fewer clicks appear "cooler" (blue/green).

![Click Heatmap Example](/img/placeholder-image.png)

Use click heatmaps to:
- Identify which elements attract the most attention
- Discover if users are clicking on non-clickable elements
- Optimize the placement of important links and buttons

### Click Count Maps

Click count maps display the actual number of clicks on each interactive element, providing precise engagement metrics.

Use click count maps to:
- Measure exact engagement with specific elements
- Compare performance of different buttons or links
- Identify the most and least clicked elements

### Scroll Heatmaps

Scroll heatmaps show how far users scroll down your page. The color gradient indicates the percentage of users who reached each part of the page.

Use scroll heatmaps to:
- Determine if users see important content below the fold
- Identify the optimal placement for key information
- Improve page layout to encourage deeper scrolling

### Attention Maps

Attention maps visualize which areas of your page receive the most user focus and engagement.

Use attention maps to:
- Understand which content elements capture user attention
- Identify areas that users find most interesting
- Optimize content placement for maximum engagement

### Reading Level Maps

Reading level maps show how users consume your content, highlighting areas that are read thoroughly versus skimmed.

Use reading level maps to:
- Understand content consumption patterns
- Identify which sections users read carefully
- Optimize content structure and formatting

## Device-Specific Views

QA ZERO allows you to view heatmaps for different device types:

- **Desktop**: Full-width view for desktop users
- **Tablet**: 768px width view for tablet users
- **Mobile**: 375px width view for mobile users

To switch between device views:

1. Open the heatmap for your page
2. Use the device selector in the top navigation
3. The heatmap will adjust to show data for the selected device type

## Filtering Heatmap Data

To focus on specific segments of your audience:

1. Open the heatmap for your page
2. Use the filter options in the sidebar:
   - Date range (custom calendar selection)
   - Traffic source (direct, search, social, referral)
   - UTM parameters (campaign, medium, source)
   - Goal completion (sessions that completed specific goals)
3. The heatmap will update to show data for the selected filters

## Analyzing Heatmap Data

When analyzing heatmaps, look for:

- **Hot spots**: Areas with high user engagement (red/orange)
- **Cold spots**: Areas with low user engagement (blue/green)
- **Unexpected patterns**: Clicks on non-clickable elements or unusual scroll patterns
- **Fold line**: The point where users need to scroll to see more content
- **Engagement drop-offs**: Points where user engagement significantly decreases

## Exporting Heatmap Data

To export heatmap data for reporting or further analysis:

1. Open the heatmap for your page
2. Click the **Export** button in the top right corner
3. Choose your preferred format (CSV, TSV)
4. Click **Download**

## Best Practices

- Collect data for at least 1,000 page views to ensure statistical significance
- Create separate analyses for desktop and mobile users
- Compare heatmaps before and after making changes to your website
- Use heatmaps in conjunction with other analytics data for a complete picture
- Regularly review heatmaps to identify optimization opportunities
